## Project Overview

This project explores **music intelligence using deep learning**, focusing on automated music classification tasks such as **genre, mood, and instrumentation recognition**. The goal is to design, train, and compare multiple deep learning architectures under a unified expeeriment framework, and to evaluate their performance on widely used public music datasets.

This project investigates three major model famiilies:
- **Conbolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for spectrogram-based learning
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs)** for temporal modeling
- **Transformer-based architectures** for long-range msucial structure via attention

The fial outcome includes a research-style comparative analysis and an  interactive demo tool that allows users to upload audio and receive predictions.

## Objectives

- Preprocess raw audio into suitable feature representations (mel-spectrograms, MFCCs)
- Implement and train CNN, LSTM, and Transformer models
- Compare models using standard evaluation metrics
- Analyze error cases and class overlaps
- Build a lightweight demo application for real-time inference
- Produce a formal written report and departmental presentation

## Datasets

This project uses publicly available music datasets commonly used in Music INforamtion
